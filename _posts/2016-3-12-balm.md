concept1: Balm is a tool to help diagnose simple medical issues, through a quiz using various questions to pinpoint the issue through symptoms, physical pains or with how you feel emotionally and mentally.  With a rough diagnoses, the app recommends plants that grow near your geographical location that can help alleviate the symptoms, with plant identification instructions, as well as recipes and instructions on how to best prepare the plant for the symptom. The United Nations have created global goals to be met by 2030.  One of the goals is good health & well-being. This goal is broken down into several smaller goals, and then broken down again into sections of what health and well-being means overall. The goal and challenge that will be focused on is broken down into interlinking stepping-stones towards a better global health. This app focuses on these three in particular.
concept2: 1. Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and noncommunicable diseases. 2. Provide access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines. 3. Provide access to medicines for all. With these smaller goals in mind, there is no clear-cut answer. In order to truly fix any global issue, systems of capitalism and poverty have to also be addressed.  While addressing those issues is also complex, we can create balms and systems to counteract these things and help us move forward towards a better world. The idea of Balm isn’t to solve this global goal. The idea of Balm is to shed light on the natural medical cures in nature, that indigenous people have used for centuries with incredible results, challenge the idea that prescriptive drugs are not always the answer, and to raise awareness about the plants around us—by extension bring interest into creating sustainable medicine that can be afforded by all.
process1: The target audience of Balm has two sides.  One target is a person, of any age, that can’t afford access to westernized medicine.  They may have access to local healers or medicinal plants, but may be lacking in money or time to visit the healer. This app would help with small issues that can be expensive, and help with figuring out what to buy or ask for. The quiz could also be used as a guide to figure out how you feel before you see a doctor, or help describe the symptoms.  The second target would be a person who does have access to westernized medicine, but is interested in alternates because of cost or curiosity.  They would be interested in learning about plants and how to prepare them, and would use this as a learning tool as well as a medicinal tool.
process2: During user testing people navigated the app alright, but there was a disconnect between the users testing and the intended audience. Primarily the language I choose to use in the app, which was heavy with technical terms and Latin, caused this issue. For the final version, I simplified the language and the process from being so overbearing and long, and to make it simple to use in non-life threatening scenarios.  Some of the suggested ideas like adding in a dictionary styled tab of all the plants wouldn’t work because of the amount of plants and this is based of the idea of the local area; the volume of plants overall is to big to store on an app. The consensus was that there should to be less jargon, and more user control over the survey in order to create a better diagnosis.

finalwords1: Balm was built to be simple. It has one job, to figure out what is wrong, and give you a solution—a solution with instructions.  The features are limited to having a favorites and history section, and if connected to the Internet, a search feature. The importance of apps today can be summed up simply. An app is a tool, like a screwdriver or a telephone—it has a purpose, can be used, and at the end of the day, people rely on it for its purpose. I can hope Balm lives up to these standards.
