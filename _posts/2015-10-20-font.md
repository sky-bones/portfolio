concept1: Villain was created with a Robin Hood era evil in mind. There was a bit of world building involved, which helped round out the font overall. The story would have been something like this; Set in Germany sometime in the late 1800s an awful cunning evil swept through the land. They wrote awful letters and had awful spirits that linger about them, and they knew far too much about poison. It was based loosely on a modern Fractura style, inspiration coming from how you would write with a chisel tipped pen.
concept2: Because I love tall skinny fonts, I decided to try combining the effect of a tall cap height with an old fashioned feel. The best part was having a story that this font would be in, it made it all the more magical to actually say, alright, how would they write this? How would the punctuation look? I was able to weave a story with just how I created the letters.  The project also included a set of dingbats, and that was fun to image what kind of bits of the world I could create.
process1: This was a long project, with multiple parts. The font began as handwritten letterforms, rewritten over and over again to get the weights and angles. It was then scanned and traced in Illustrator, where it was adjusted to a grid and made the same weight. At this point, we exported one letter out to be 3D printed, which was incredible to do, and to see how exactly the letter physically looks.
process2: Once the letters, numbers, and punctuation were completed, they were brought into Glyphs to adjust them further. There was where the kerning and leading were created, as well as doing some custom pairs for certain letters.  The final part was creating a poster to celebrate the font. These posters each had to talk about an aspect of the font.

finalwords1: Poster 1 reads E IS FOR EYES that peer through the dark, watching and waiting, weeping, withering in darkness. Villain has a narrow aperture, which allows for a condensed look. The arcs are sharply transitioned much like a brushstroke of ink, narrow to wide and full. Perfect for that dreadful letter you mean to send. Poster 2 reads  X IS FOR XANTHIC the nitrogenous compound found in the blood you left behind when you killed the queen and her men. Their ghosts still clamor outside your windows. Villain has a large x-height, emphasized by the tall ascenders and descenders. Lowercase letters are half the height of the uppercase, which allows you to recount how the queen was murdered in more detail.
finalwords2: Poster 3 reads R IS FOR RAVENS who gather around your home in a great cloud of unkindness, shadowing the sun and moon from reaching the tall dark windows. Villain has downturned terminals that taper and turn like the sharp beak of the raven. The terminals are reflected throughout the font.
