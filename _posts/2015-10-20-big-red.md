tools: InDesign
concept: This piece was inspired by the huge newsprint layouts. I love the idea of having a magazine, which usually makes great use of the space, and a newspaper that takes up every inch possible, and reversing it.  The overall idea was to use this layout for a series of unrelated articles, and have it work together and cope with each article need.
process: I made the sheet size 22x17, and created a grid that made use of the space—and that fit the enormous cap height, and allowed for columns to fit comfortably.  I used Futura for the titles and copy, and because of its wonderful even tendencies, I was able to fully justify the type without fighting the font or columns. I used ITC Century for pull quotes, headings and other little details.  The most interesting part was the colour. I did the red and black as Pantone colours, in order to allow for the transparency. This would increase the readability of the body copy overtop of the title or quote.

finalwords: Overall, this piece was a joy to work on. I’ve yet to print it on a sheet of newsprint, but I look forward to it! This piece fulfilled the desire to make something obnoxiously large and bold, and something that demanded attention no matter what article was in place.
