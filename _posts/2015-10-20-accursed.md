concept:
process: Accursed was a process of trying out different styles. I began with trying a layered effect, that the hands would be layers and layers thick. After a while, sketch after sketch, it morphed into trying to use shapes to represent different parts of the hand, and then to a style where it was all simple shapes. This worked well with the idea of creating something out of pieces, and the style of stained glass. I scanned in the illustration, traced it, and created the first version with typography.
