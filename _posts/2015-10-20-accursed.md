concept:
process: Accursed was a process of trying out different styles. I began with trying a layered effect, that the hands would be layers and layers thick. After a while, sketch after sketch, it morphed into trying to use shapes to represent different parts of the hand, and then to a style where it was all simple shapes. This worked well with the idea of piecing together, and the style of stained glass (much like those in churches)
