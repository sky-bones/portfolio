concept1: This is a project I worked on during my internship with LOKI. The logo and concept was created by Kevin, and it was approved before I arrived. I worked on the accompanying pieces to finish up the project.
concept2: After my internship was complete, I created a digital component to expand the brand and explore how it could change as an online form.
process1: The process was a straight forward one, I would create the cards or notepads, it was checked over by Kevin and then sent to the client for approval.

finalwords1: This was a sweet and welcoming project to start off my internship with! It was a great refresher on clients and a reminder of how working for a client means that sometimes, you really do have to change the layout back to the way it was before just without the spaces.
