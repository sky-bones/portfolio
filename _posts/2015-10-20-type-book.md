title: Survival Series
imagename: quotebook.jpg
tools: Photoshop, InDesign
concept: holy moses
process: In order to preserve the texture of the paint, I printed out textures and hand painted the words onto it. I then photographed it, and Photoshoped the photos for errors and colour corrections. The book had to have a strict grid structure that both sides honored. The book was printed out at 8x8.
