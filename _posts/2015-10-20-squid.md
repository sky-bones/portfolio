concept1: My first job was a fishmonger. Awful as it sounds, it taught me how to find just about anything beautiful. My best party so far trick is filleting a fish. This job was the reason this project was so easy to do.
concept2: I handled squid all the time, and the texture never failed to amaze me. I had to redesign the cover for 20, 000 Leagues under the Sea, so what better use for squid tentacles then to make a book cover?
process1: This project was a long process. It began with sketching out my ideas, and a vector rendition. This wasn’t true to originally what I wanted, and I felt like it was honestly a bit of a failure. Later on, I decided to go with my original idea, which was to get actual squid tentacles and create the letters.
process2: I photographed them in pairs of letters, or as many letters as I could. Then I had to combine all the photos into a single image, and I’m still working on the final type.
