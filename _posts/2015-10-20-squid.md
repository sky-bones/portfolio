concept1: My first job was as a fishmonger. Awful as it sounds, it taught me how to find just about anything beautiful. I handled squid all the time, and the texture never failed to amaze me. I decided to redesign the cover for 20, 000 Leagues under the Sea, so what better use for squid tentacles then to make a book cover?
concept2: The original concept was dashed because of a lack of time, but over the last year, the pieces came together. I photographed the squids last year, so the project began to take shape.
process1: This project was a long process. It began with sketching out my ideas, and a vector rendition. This wasnâ€™t true to originally what I wanted, and I felt like it was honestly a bit of a failure. Later on, I decided to go with my original idea, which was to get actual squid tentacles and create the letters.
process2: I photographed them in pairs of letters, or as many letters as I could. Then I had to combine all the photos into a single image, a process I started last year; the final image produced was closer to my intent. I took the piece to a variety of portfolio viewings, and the feedback helped solidify the idea into what it needed to be.

finalwords1: I finished this project this year, almost three years after I first had my idea. I'm glad it took me so long to complete, it allowed me to see how an idea can progress over time and how my work and style has changed since I began.
finalwords2: I've always loved books, and the idea of making book covers, creating the type and ideas is something I've always wanted to do. This is hopefully the first step of many to creating more.
