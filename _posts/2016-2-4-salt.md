glamouralt: Two posters. The first is a bleeding blue hand, holding themselves up by a pink crystal on a yellow background. The background text reads 'where are my eyes'. the second is a bleeding blue hand hanging limply from above on a pink background. the background text reads 'when you open your mouth to scream there is only one'
concept1: Salt is a short story that I wrote in 2014. The idea came from an illustration I’d done a year earlier, that needed a rationale. I’ve always loved Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov, and I loved stories where things weren’t quite normal. The character in Salt begins in the readers imagination, but later the reader realizes that something is very wrong.
concept2: The moral of Salt is that there isn’t always an answer for why something happens, and even if the perpetrator promises an answer, it’s not one that will help heal the damage that has been done. The story itself is a very literal take on it, but it was a way to help figure out that what had happened didn’t need a solution; in fact the solution was to walk away.
process1: Salt began as a design for a phone case. I wrote a short explanation, and it grew from there. I wrote the story in short chunks, and let the characters come to life in this salt cave. I began designing a website, wanting to create an interesting and accessible way of viewing my work. It was difficult, but it was my first interactive project.
process2: I created a rigid and geometric art style for the website. I animated different subtle elements to bring them to life, and a header to bring readers in. Later I painted the two main illustrations in Photoshop, and layered them into promo-style posters. I used a line from the story and Eurostile LT Std.

finalwords1: Salt is the first piece of fiction that I created multiple works for. It inspired me to create other web-based stories, and to search out other authors that work the same way. Salt has transformed the way I approach art and fiction.
