concept: Salt is a short story that I wrote in 2014. The original idea came from an illustration I’d done a year earlier, and it came to life after a difficult time in my life came to an end. The story itself has a personal moral, and the project itself helped me come to terms with the situation. The moral of Salt is that there isn’t always an answer for why something happens, and even if the perpetrator promises an answer, it’s not one that will help heal the damage that has been done. The story itself is a very literal take on it, but it was a way to help figure out that what had happened didn’t need a solution; in fact the solution was to walk away.
