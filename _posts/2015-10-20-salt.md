tools: HTML, CSS, Illustrator, Photoshop
concept: Salt is a short story that I wrote in 2014. The original idea came from an illustration I’d done a year earlier, and it came to life after a difficult time in my life came to an end. The story itself has a personal moral, and the project itself helped me come to terms with the situation. The moral of Salt is that there isn’t always an answer for why something happens, and even if the perpetrator promises an answer, it’s not one that will help heal the damage that has been done. The story itself is a very literal take on it, but it was a way to help figure out that what had happened didn’t need a solution; in fact the solution was to walk away.
process: Salt began as a design on a phone case in 2013. I’d written a short rationale about it, and from there the idea grew. When I had to design a website, the process of writing, finding an art style, and coding it came together to become an interactive website. Salt was very personal, so trying to distance myself with creating otherworldly persons helped to create a world where I could write about my experience in abstract terms. The art became very rigid and geometric, is doted throughout the site. Later I decided to redo the original art, and pained both pieces in Photoshop.

finalwords: Salt is a project dear to my heart, and at any stage of the game, stayed with me. Salt inspired me to write more fiction, to create more art, and helped me recover and move on from an experience. I hope you enjoy reading Salt as much as I enjoyed creating this series.
