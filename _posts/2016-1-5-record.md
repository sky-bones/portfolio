concept1: OFF is an indie game written by Mortis Ghost. The game follows the adventures of the Batter through a strange universe that you must fight through. The game was the first look into alternative storytelling and indie games, (even if I am a little late!). It also opened the doors to subtly horror and how to induce fear with explicitly stating it. I've replicated the ideas of the game in the record cover, which when you look at, you realize that it's not quite right.
concept2:
process1: Accursed was a process of trying out different styles. I began with trying a layered effect, that the hands would be layers and layers thick. After a while, sketch after sketch, it morphed into trying to use shapes to represent different parts of the hand, and then to a style where it was all simple shapes.
process2: This worked well with the idea of creating something out of pieces, and the style of stained glass. I scanned in the illustration, traced it, and created the first version with typography.

finalwords1: Accursed was a project that I could add a personal touch. I’ve read enough Ray Bradbury to know how this competition goes, and enough science fiction to know exactly how that intelligence feels.
finalwords2: This poster was a way to add in a bit of humor, poke a bit of fun at what was going on, and still have something that you’d see around the city.

finalalt: Three posters in different colour schemes. The first is a blue hand reaching to a red hand on a black background. The second is blue hands reaching towards each other on a gray background. The third is a mixture of purple, green and cream colours for both hands on a light grey background.
