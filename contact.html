		<p> Jewish | INFP | Pisces | she/her</p>
		<p>I am a Graphic Designer, writer, and supporter of life choices. I am in my final year of college at Algonquin College in Ottawa. I write short fiction stories, draw a ton of eyes, and have a deep and unshakable love for layouts. For as long as I have been looking at design, I have been told that giving back to the community is important. My high school teacher, Mr. Oster, always gave back. He helped everyone and anyone, and he worked hard to make the school and community a vibrant and wonderful place.</p>

		<p>I love plants of every kind, grilled cheese, rocks, and I own approximately 32 sketchbooks. Unusual stories and flowers are my weakness. I can fillet a fish, identify over 100 flowers and plants, and once I read Dante's Inferno for a project.</p>
